# Student Scheduling and Grouping Algorithms
Example genetic algorithm for scheduling students and grouping them by diversity.  A poster was presented on this work at the University of Arizona IT Summit 2016.  [View the poster.](https://github.com/kiwicayne/student-scheduling/blob/master/Group%20Diversity%20and%20Scheduling%20with%20Genetic%20Algorithms.pdf)

There are 3 batch files which can be run:
* makeGroups.bat - This demonstrates grouping students by diversity
* makeSchedule.bat - This demonstrates filling activities with students while fullfilling complex enrollment requirments and activity contraints
* runApi.bat - A simple API for calling the grouping and scheduling code

This is currently only setup to run on Windows.  However, the code is completely cross platform.  

To build run .\build.cmd.
